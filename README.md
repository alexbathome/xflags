# Expressive flags for Go

[![Go Reference](https://pkg.go.dev/badge/github.com/cavaliergopher/xflags.svg)](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/cavaliergopher/xflags)

Package xflags provides an alternative to Go's flag package for defining and
parsing command line arguments with an emphasis on the following:

* Subcommands are a first class citizen
* Common features such as required arguments or shorthand flag names are simple
  and clear to express
* Reduce the plumbing required for large programs

This package is currently under development and not ready for stable release.
